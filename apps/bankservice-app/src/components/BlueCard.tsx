        This is a simulated NetBanking page demonstrating the workflow of the
        FinTransact application. It shows how users are redirected during the
        onRamping process. Please enter your FinTransact username and click
        'Continue' to proceed with the demonstration. This simulates entering
        your credentials on a real banking service page.
